### Screenshot

![](Images/Screenshot%20of%20Omlette%20Recipe%20WebPage.png)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

## My process

- I started by reading through the project and jotting down the things that I would need to add and or research to complete this project (creating a checklist.) I learnt this from watching Jess from freeCodeCamp.org code on Youtube.
- Added all the text
- Made the margins of the content and gave the content a container - I learnt how to do this from checking W3 Schools
- Created a CSS file and tinkered with the text to give them style. I learnt this from Mosh Hamadani's 1 hour html beginner class and from SheCode
- Created he unordered and orderd list.
- Added the image and ensured the style was in check
- Linked my css file to my html file which I learnt from the HTML beginner classes by Bro Code
- Worked on the table. I learnt from W3 Schools and Bro Code on You tube
- Tried getting the correct colors of the design without the frontend mentor pro account, at first I used some online color code finder tools, and realized it wasn't looking accurate, so I opted to use canva.
- Created the Prep time container and used the google dev editor to tinker to ensure it was looking like the design provided.
- Editied the small details and cleaned up my code
- Made the design compatible with mobile
- Validated my code

### Built with

I used Visual Studio Code
I used HTML and CSS

### What I learned

I learned how to create

- Different types of content tables
- Headers, rows, and box shadows
- How to make my web page design compatible with a mobile device

How to use

- Git
- Github

The best places to research - twitter, discord, github, W3Schools, Frontendmentor spaces, stack overflow, and Youtube

### Continued development

I want to work on my HTML and CSS skills well enough to be able to do move from newbie projects to Junior Projects before I strat working on my JS skills. I want to hone my HTML and CSS skills.

Bro code is a fast teacher
It is really cool to watch developers code and realize that even seasoned developers have problems when they are coding. It made me feel like I'll get there - it was encouraging. Thank you Free Code camp
